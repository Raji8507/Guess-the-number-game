# Guess-the-number-game
A simple and fun "Guess the Number" game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user tries to guess a random number between 1 and 10. The score starts at 10 and decreases with each wrong guess. A great beginner-friendly project to practice DOM manipulation and basic game logic.
